# what is oppt-one?
oppt-one es una dapp (aplicacion decentralizada) para publicar los documentos de autodeterminacion segun el procedimiento OPPT.


# How it works
0. Create and prepare your documents
1. Use this Dapp to Upload your documents (original and courtesy transalations) to IPFS 
2. Get the QR code of the your NFT (le QR code sert a pouvoir mettre a disposition tous les documents a chaque autorité et ne pas se charger de tout ça tout le temps avec nous)
3. Include them in your universal pass or show them to whoever you wish and you see fit.
4. Optionaly index you IAM code to be available in the oppt-one's public registry through our dedicated smart contract by minting an non transfereable NFT. This process is reversible thorugh burning and allows several DAO mechanismes 


# WARNING
All data uploaded to oppt.one is publically available to anyone who requests it using the correct CID. Do not store any private or sensitive information in an unencrypted form using Oppt.one.

## Permanent Data
Deleting files from the Oppt.one site’s Files page will remove them from the file listing for your account, but that doesn’t prevent nodes on the decentralized storage network from retaining copies of the data indefinitely. Do not use Oppt.one for data that may need to be permanently deleted in the future.
