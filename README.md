## Description

Let's say Bob needs to borrow 200 USD, but he doesn’t want to ask for credit in a bank. Maybe a friend (or someone in his network of trust) can lend him that money without paying for interest. So, his friend Alice lends him the 200 bucks as he promises her to give it back in 90 days.

With **HonorLoans**, Bob mints a new token called Bobcoin, for the amount of the loan and gives it to Alice. That's cool for three reasons:

1. They both have a remainder (in the form of an NFT) for the amount of the loan and the conditions they agreed to, a very useful thing to have as our memory is not flawless.
2. If she wishes, Alice can use Bobcoins at Bob’s store.
3. Bob can accept other participant’s coins to progressively pay for this loan.

As Bob progressively pays his debt during this cycle, Bobcoins now become Alicecoins. Having liquidity, these newly minted Alicecoins can be directly used as a form of payment between other **HonorLoans** network of trust participants. The balance is dynamically reflected in each respective NFT wallet that each participant holds.

At the end of the cycle, if Bob didn't pay for the loan, he loses his honourability, being banned to create new loans and being banned from the network until he restores his honor.
